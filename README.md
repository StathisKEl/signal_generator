# signal_generator
A signal generator based on the XR2206CP IC capable of producing a sine, a triangular and a square waveform.

Inside the signal_generator.pdf file there are two images of the signal generator that has been constructed. The two rotary potentiometers with the label f under them that are shown in the first of these two images are used for setting the frequency of the waveform and the rotary potentiometer with the label a under it that is shown in the same image is used for setting the amplitude of the waveform. Unlike the amplitude of the waveform which is fixed in the case of the square waveform the frequency of the waveform can change in the cases of all three waveforms. Regarding the ON-OFF switch this component is used for switching between the sine and the triangular waveform. Finally the two trimmers are used for changing the rate with which the waveform reaches its maximum and its minimum value and the rate with which the waveform moves away from the above values.

The terminal block with the two pins is used for powering the signal generator with a 12V power supply and the terminal block with the three pins is used for getting access to the three waveforms. In more details the pin with the label sq and the pin with the label - output the square waveform while the pin with the label si/tr and the pin with the label - output the sine and the triangular waveform accordingly to the position of the ON-OFF switch.
